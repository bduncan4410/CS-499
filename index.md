## Welcome to CS 499 Capstone

My Name is Brian Duncan, and this is my capstone page that showcases enhancements made to a simple project created to work with JUnit testing.


##What was the project?
The project was originally a simple application that was used to write testing for an application that had objects called Task, Contact, and appointment.
This project had no ui and its sole purpose was to work with the testing software.

## What enhancements are planned for the project?
The project is looking at a large overhaul. The first enhancement that is going to be made is the addition and creation of a Model View Controller Design Pattern.
This pattern is often used in a team environment as well as a web environment. The main goal of this pattern is to distinguish different aspects of the application such that multiple people can work on the code simultaneously.
The next enhancement was to add a database to store the models. This was a large enhancement due to a lot of the methods having to be reworked in order to send data to the database instead of objects and arrays within the application.  The main technology that was used in this project was JDBC and SQL server due to their ease of use and popularity. 
The last enhancement, which was the most important was updating and patching any security flaws in the code. This flaws ranged from variable accessibility to SQL injection attacks. SQL injection attacks occur when a user is able to input sql code the returns data that was not intended for it. This attacks can be prevented by restricting the users input of characters such as an equal sign. 

##What are the future plans for this project?
The project has some functionality after all of the enhancement are implemented, but it does not have a user interface to use those functions. The main goal in future updates is to add a graphical web base user interface from which the user can access their own contacts from anywhere.
  
##Profressional Self Accessment
During the creation of this project, I pushed myself to try something I have never done before, to create a full functionality database application. In this project, I created a database application using java and JDBC as well as created the skeleton of the database from scratch in Sql Server. My abilities were tested as JDBC was not a current skill I possessed; however, I had worked with Java extensively in the past which made it easier to learn for me. I enjoy working with databases which made the project fun for me to complete. The user interface is something that is lacking in this application but will be worked on. After this class is over, I plan to pursue this project further and develop a fully functional UI since It is not something I have ever attempted before. 
In the past, I have developed applications in Java, but none that work with a database. In addition, I have also worked a lot with SQL in a few dialects but have never linked one to an application. In a past project, I created scripts to create a database using SQL server as well as NoSql. When looking for potential careers I will be looking for one that encompasses both of these technologies as they are both extremely interesting and fun to work with. 
I have impressed myself with this project because of all of the thought I put behind every aspect of the code. I took a couple of simple class objects and turned them into models that had purpose.  Taking the application from the drawing board all the way to where it has come now has shown me the entire process of an applications development. I was shown the good and the bad, learning from my mistakes and finding shortcuts to help me in the future.

Each of the artifacts in my portfolio build on one another, from start to finish. The first project displays my understanding of the model view controller ideology. Working in MVC has many benefits such as improved team productivity and easily readable code. The second project shows my ability to modify code to implement a database. This was done in SQL Server but can also be edited to run on any dialect of SQL. The last project also demonstrates my ability to identify and secure flaws in the code that could allow hackers into the code.  All three of these implementations into the final project have shown that I am capable of developing strong well thought out applications.
